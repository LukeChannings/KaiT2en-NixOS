Fan controller application written in Rust for T2 Macs running Linux.
Supports applesmc, macsmc hwmon and t2smc (https://github.com/deqrocks/t2-smc) hwmon paths.


T2 Fan Control provides a compact desktop interface for monitoring temperatures and editing a four-point fan curve with a model-specific system-temperature target.

Fan control is handled by a background daemon integrated with systemd. This keeps the state persistent across boot, suspend and resume, while the GUI talks to the daemon over a Unix socket.

## How fan control works

The controller deliberately keeps normal component cooling and retained system heat separate. It samples the available temperatures every two seconds and derives three different values.

### Curve temperature

The editable fan curve follows the hotter of the CPU and GPU. It does not use an average and it does not use unrelated board, storage or enclosure sensors.

- CPU is the arithmetic mean of the SMC sensors `TC0E` (CPU 1 Diode Virtual) and `TC0F` (CPU 1 Diode Filtered). If only one is readable, that reading is used.
- GPU is the highest available reading from GPU Proximity, GPU Die digital, GPU Die analog and GPU Voltage Regulator.
- If no GPU temperature is available, the curve follows CPU alone. The UI changes its description accordingly.
- If only a GPU temperature is available, the curve follows GPU alone.

CPU and dGPU are fixed curve inputs and cannot be removed or replaced. An optional third curve sensor can be selected from the other valid monitored sensors. With a third sensor selected, the curve follows the highest value among CPU, dGPU and that sensor. `None` is the default.

Curve points are limited to 100 C. Once the curve temperature rises above the rightmost point, both fans are commanded to 100%, regardless of that point's configured speed.

The optional sensor is drawn as its own line in the curve and temperature graphs. Its controls, the any-sensor protection and the overrun time are grouped under `Advanced settings` to keep the main view focused on normal fan control.

`Curve temp` shows the value currently fed into the curve. `Curve sensor` identifies the CPU or GPU sensor responsible for that value.

### System temperature and system target

The system temperature is the arithmetic mean of the currently readable positive SMC temperatures, excluding CPU core, CPU die and CPU package sensors. Zero, negative and unreadable values are ignored. This broad average is intended to reflect heat retained by the logic board, cooling assembly and enclosure without overweighting CPU telemetry.

The red vertical wall in the curve editor is the configurable system-temperature target:

- Both fans are forced to 100% when the system average reaches 2 C above the target.
- Forced cooling remains active until the system average reaches 2 C below the target.
- For example, a 45 C target engages at 47 C and releases at 43 C.
- The resulting 4 C hysteresis band prevents rapid fan cycling around the target.
- The wall can be moved from 30 C to 100 C.

Forced system cooling also has a configurable `Overrun time` from 0 to 600 seconds, with a default of 5 seconds. Once engaged, cooling is released only after both conditions are true:

- The configured minimum cooling time has elapsed.
- The system average has remained at or below `target - 2 C` continuously for 20 seconds.

If the temperature rises above the lower boundary during that 20-second confirmation window, the window starts over. There is deliberately no minimum off time, so rising temperatures can always engage cooling immediately.

The system target is controlled only by the system average. A high CPU or GPU temperature continues to follow the normal curve and cannot independently engage the system-target latch.

### Optional any-sensor protection

An optional checkbox can force both fans to 100% when the highest positive reading from any monitored temperature sensor reaches an adjustable threshold. The threshold accepts values from 0 C to 100 C. This protection is disabled by default and is independent of both the CPU/GPU curve and the system-average wall.

The any-sensor protection uses a 5 C release hysteresis: a threshold of 90 C engages at 90 C and releases at 85 C. A value of 0 C therefore intentionally keeps forced cooling active whenever any valid positive sensor is available.

### Editing the curve

The curve contains exactly four points:

- All four points can be moved horizontally and vertically, but cannot cross each other.
- Curve points may sit on either side of the system wall because the two controls are independent.
- Moving the system wall never moves, scales or limits the fan curve.

Fan percentages are relative to each fan's reported minimum and maximum RPM. Therefore `0%` means the hardware minimum RPM, not a stopped fan.

### Monitoring values

`Hottest sensor` is informational and is independent of the fan-curve input. It reports the highest positive reading among all monitored sensors using a human-readable name, for example `PCH Diode · 78 C`. The fan details show how many valid temperature sensors are currently being monitored.

## Default configuration

New installations use:

```ini
config_version=2
automatic_control_enabled=true
autostart_enabled=false
system_temp_target_c=45
system_cooling_time_s=5
any_sensor_enabled=false
any_sensor_temp_c=100
curve_sensor_key=
custom_curve=0:10,35:14,71:25,93:64
```

Curve entries use `temperature:speed-percent` pairs. The active configuration is stored at:

```text
/etc/t2-fancontrol/config.txt
```

It can be inspected with:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/t2-fancontrol/config.txt
```

Configurations from the earlier preset-based controller do not describe the new control model safely. A file without `config_version=2` is therefore replaced with the defaults above when the daemon starts. Once migrated, version 2 user changes are preserved.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Unpack it
3. Run:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```
This step is mandatory. It puts the binary, desktop entry, icon and systemd service in the correct system locations, then enables and starts `t2-fancontrol.service`.

If `t2fanrd.service` is present, `sudo make install` disables and stops it automatically to avoid conflicts.

`sudo make install` does all of the following:

- installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin/t2-fancontrol-gtk`
- installs the desktop entry to `/usr/local/share/applications/org.t2fancontrol.gtk.desktop`
- installs the icon to `/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/org.t2fancontrol.gtk.svg`
- installs the systemd unit to `/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/t2-fancontrol.service`
- reloads systemd
- enables and starts `t2-fancontrol.service`
- disables and stops `t2fanrd.service` if it exists

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

This removes the installed files, disables `t2-fancontrol.service`, and re-enables `t2fanrd.service` if it is present on the system.

`sudo make uninstall` does all of the following:

- disables and stops `t2-fancontrol.service`
- removes the installed binary
- removes the desktop entry
- removes the installed icon
- removes the installed systemd unit
- reloads systemd
- re-enables and starts `t2fanrd.service` if it exists

## Build Dependencies

You need a Rust toolchain and the usual native build dependencies for GTK4 and Libadwaita.

- `cargo`
- `make`
- `pkg-config`
- `glib-compile-resources`
- GTK4 development files
- Libadwaita development files
