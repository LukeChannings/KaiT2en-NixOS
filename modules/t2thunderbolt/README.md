# t2thunderbolt

`t2thunderbolt` supplies the missing power-management dependencies between
Thunderbolt PCIe ports and their NHI on Apple T2 Macs. These device links make
the driver core resume the NHI before ports whose PCIe tunnels it restores.

The module is a quirk helper and does not bind to the Thunderbolt controller or
replace the in-tree `thunderbolt` driver. Titan Ridge controllers are matched
through their PCIe switch topology. Ice Lake controllers use Apple's `TRP*`
ACPI root-port names and are limited to the two Ice Lake NHI PCI IDs.

The module does not override PCI D3 policy. Titan Ridge xHCI controllers and
their downstream ports remain under the PCI core's runtime-PM policy. PM
ordering links cover the Thunderbolt hotplug ports and NHIs.
