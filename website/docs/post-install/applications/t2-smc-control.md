# T2 SMC Control

Displays SMC temperatures, fan speeds, power data, and the hardware clock, and
can write the current system time to that clock. The battery charge limit is
shown but not set here: `t2smc` exposes it as the standard
`charge_control_end_threshold`, so the desktop environment offers it in its own
power settings. Note that this data shown in this app is direct hardware readings. It is
the single source of truth for temperatures and battery statistics. 
Desktop environment's readings of battery charge are only estimations.
As we promised to ship a vanilla Fedora with KaiT2en sugar on top, we did not
manipulate it to show SMC values in Gnome/Plasma. This will later be solved
when upstreaming SMC. 

With a charge limit set, the background service `t2-smc-gaugingd` lifts it for
a full charge from time to time, like macOS does. A battery that never charges
to full keeps its gauge from recalibrating, and the reported charge can then
collapse under load.
