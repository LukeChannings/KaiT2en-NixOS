# Audio DSP

This page explains the audio DSP support that KAIT2EN installs automatically.
It is not an installation guide. All profiles are installed together.
Supported Macs select the matching profile at runtime. Unsupported models
continue to use the native T2 audio devices.

## DSP in general

The T2 audio driver exposes the physical speaker channels, but the T2 does not
apply the model-specific processing to audio coming from the host; macOS does
that on the host as well. KAIT2EN provides that processing as a PipeWire
filter graph per model.

Depending on the model, the graph

- distributes stereo audio across the physical woofer and tweeter channels
- applies the model's equalization and crossovers as biquad filters
- applies a multiband compressor and limiters
- widens the stereo image with crosstalk cancellation
- adds virtual-bass processing

The biquad chains are cheap compared with the FIR convolution used before.

On supported Macs, the resulting output appears as **DSP Speakers** device. The
unprocessed **Apple Internal Speakers** device remains available for comparison
and diagnostics. Headphones do not pass through the speaker DSP graph.

udev identifies the model from DMI and assigns a short ALSA card ID.
WirePlumber uses that ID and the UCM Speaker/Mic node to select a graph.
There is no install-time PCI-address substitution. KAIT2EN does not reuse a
profile on an unlisted model. Reboot after installing or removing `t2-dsp`.

## Automatic selection

The WirePlumber software-DSP integration gives the DSP sink a higher session
priority than the underlying speaker sink. WirePlumber should therefore select
the DSP output automatically when the profile is first created.

## Profile origins and support

The speaker and microphone graphs are KAIT2EN's own work and are generated
per model. The license information lives under `dsp/` in the repository and
is shipped in `/usr/share/licenses/t2-dsp/` with the package.

Thanks to [lemmyg](https://github.com/lemmyg/t2-apple-audio-dsp) for the
pioneering work: the first PipeWire DSP graphs for T2 Macs were his, and they
were the template KAIT2EN's audio DSP started from.

Problems with these profiles must be reported to the
[KAIT2EN issue tracker](https://github.com/kaiT2en/KaiT2en-Fedora/issues),
not to lemmyg's project: the current graphs, routing and UCM integration are
maintained here.

## Check the active output

The sound settings should show the model-specific DSP output on a supported
Mac. PipeWire can also list it directly:

```bash
wpctl status
```

The active sink is marked with an asterisk. If the DSP device is missing after
the regular installation and a reboot, include the model identifier and this
output in a KAIT2EN issue:

```bash
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_name
wpctl status
journalctl --user -b -u wireplumber -u pipewire -u pipewire-pulse
```
